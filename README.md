# VanguadrdAssault (Training Project)

A small Unreal Engine project created during my **Foxminded** UE game development course.  
This is a simple tank shooter prototype where I experimented with basic multiplayer logic, player movement, shooting, and replication.

⚠️ Please note: this was one of my first Unreal Engine projects,  
so the code structure might be a bit rough — it’s mostly a learning sandbox.
